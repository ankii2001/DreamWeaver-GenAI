Banku had always loved the peaceful town where he grew up, surrounded by mountains and rivers. But now, on his 20th birthday, he stood in the heart of a bustling city. With a briefcase in hand, he looked up at the towering buildings that stretched into the sky. This was the day he was no longer just a boy.

“I’m a man now,” he thought, filled with both excitement and nervousness. He had big dreams of succeeding in the city, working hard to provide for his family back home. But as he stared at the tall office building ahead of him, a soft image of his cozy house, nestled in the small town, appeared in his mind.

Though he was in the city, Banku knew he could never forget where he came from — his family was always with him in his heart.
