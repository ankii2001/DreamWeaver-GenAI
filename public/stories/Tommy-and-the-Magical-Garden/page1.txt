Tommy was a cheerful boy with a love for adventure and helping those he cared about. One sunny afternoon, he visited his grandmother’s house. Grandma Rose had a lovely garden filled with colorful flowers. But today, she seemed a bit tired, and the garden needed some care. Tommy decided he'd help make Grandma Rose’s garden bloom even more beautifully.

He grabbed the watering can, and with each sprinkle, the flowers began to dance with joy. The garden was soon filled with a rainbow of colors as the sun shone brightly, adding sparkle to each dew-kissed petal. Grandma Rose watched from her cozy chair on the porch, her eyes twinkling like the stars they often looked at together.

Tommy felt proud and happy seeing his grandmother smile. “Thank you, Tommy,” she said, hugging him tightly. “With your help, my garden is even more magical.”
