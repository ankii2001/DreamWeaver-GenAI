Lila fluttered closer, her vibrant feathers shimmering in the sunlight. "Bananas are my favorite too!" she chirped with a smile. "But I’m still a bit hungry, I think I’ll search for some fruit on my own."

Miko giggled, handing her a piece of his banana. "Here, this will keep you energized for your search." Lila pecked at the banana happily, her eyes sparkling with joy.

After a few moments of chatting, Miko and Lila decided to explore the jungle together. They both loved going on little adventures, discovering new things, and helping each other out. Miko swung from tree to tree, while Lila flew alongside him, her wings cutting through the air with ease.

"This jungle is full of surprises!" Lila exclaimed. "We should see what else we can find today!" Miko nodded, his eyes full of excitement as they set off on their journey.
