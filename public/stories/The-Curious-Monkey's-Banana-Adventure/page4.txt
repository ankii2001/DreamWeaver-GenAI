The duo ventured deeper into the jungle, where the trees grew even taller, and the air became thick with the scent of sweet fruits. They reached a clearing and spotted something unusual—an old, twisted vine hanging from a high branch, leading to a small hidden waterfall. The water cascaded down over smooth rocks, creating a mist that sparkled in the sunlight.

"Wow!" Miko exclaimed, his eyes wide with wonder. "I’ve never seen this before!" He could hardly wait to explore it further.

Lila fluttered excitedly around the waterfall. "Let’s go check it out!" she suggested. Miko eagerly grabbed onto the vine and, with a little swing, jumped into the cool, refreshing water. Lila followed, soaring above him, her wings skimming the mist.

They both laughed as they splashed around, the cool water refreshing their fur and feathers. "This is the best day ever!" Miko cheered. "You’re right, Lila. There’s always something new to discover!"
