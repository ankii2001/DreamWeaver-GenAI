In the heart of the African Savanna, an enormous elephant named Ella and a tiny ant named Andy were best friends. One day, they decided to cross the Great Gushing River together.

“Will you help me cross, Ella?” chirped Andy.

“Of course, my little friend!” Ella replied, her trunk held high. As they approached, Ella marveled at the water's shimmer while Andy gazed up in awe.

Ella lowered her trunk for Andy to climb aboard. As they stepped into the river, cool water swirled around Ella's feet, but she carefully balanced to keep Andy safe.

On the other side, they found a meadow of colorful flowers. Delighted, they celebrated, knowing their friendship could conquer anything.
