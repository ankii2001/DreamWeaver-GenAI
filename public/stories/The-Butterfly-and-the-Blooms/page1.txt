Once upon a time, in a colorful meadow, lived a cheerful butterfly named Bela. One day, she noticed a lonely, wilting sunflower named Bella. "Why are you so sad?" Bela asked. Bella sighed, "I'm lonely. All my friends were picked, and now I'm alone."

Bela, feeling sorry, promised to be her friend. Every day, she shared stories from the meadow, bringing joy to Bella. In return, Bella swayed in the wind, offering shade and comfort.

Over time, other flowers gathered around, enchanted by their friendship. The meadow blossomed with laughter and color, proving that friendship was the most beautiful bloom of all.

As the seasons changed, Bela and Bella’s friendship only grew stronger. Bela’s wings became more vibrant with every story she shared, and Bella’s petals stood taller and brighter in the warmth of their bond. Together, they reminded the meadow that even in times of loneliness, kindness and companionship could bring new life and beauty to the world around them.
